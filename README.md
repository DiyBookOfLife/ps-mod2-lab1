# Reflection - Interactive Accessibility Lesson

What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

- Determining where and when ARIA is necessary was the most challenging because it seems like it's only necessary when using container elements like div or span but best practices are to avoid them.

How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

- ARIA attributes improves users experience because it adds context information that isn't already programmed in certain elements. This allows users to navigate and understand the behavior of elements.

What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

- I used Devtools and https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/ and they were both very helpful. I think it's easier to use Devtools instead of that website because you don't have to manually enter colors.
